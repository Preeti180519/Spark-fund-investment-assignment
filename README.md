# Spark-fund-investment-assignment
Objective: To understand the global trends in investments so that investment decisions can be made effectively. 
           Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:
           1) It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment
           2) It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in.
